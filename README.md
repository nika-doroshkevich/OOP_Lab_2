What have I done :question:

This is my second lab using OOP. And I developed graphics editor. This lab complements the [first](https://github.com/nika-doroshkevich/OOP_Lab_1) OOP lab.

:white_check_mark: The task was as follows:

- Extend the [example with graphic shapes](https://github.com/nika-doroshkevich/OOP_Lab_1) so that shapes can be created from the user interface (my way: dialog input of values).
- The creation of the object must be performed without changing the existing code. 
- Shape classes should not contain a drawing method.
